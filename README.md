This case study is a comprehensive analysis of data crimes from 2001 to present using various data engineering tools and practices. The goal of this project is to provide insights into crime trends, patterns, and correlations using datasets from Airflow, AWS, GCP, DBT, PySpark, PyFlink, and other related technologies.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
* Analyze the impact of data crimes on law enforcement and communities
* Identify trends and patterns in data crime statistics
* Evaluate the effectiveness of different tools and practices in processing large datasets related to crime data
* Provide insights that can inform policy and decision-making for data crime prevention and mitigation.

#### Dashboard Visualization:
To visualize the trends and patterns in crime data, we will be creating a dashboard using Tableau, Power BI, or similar visualization tools. The dashboard will display key findings, including:

##### 1. Time series plots of crime rates over time
* Daily/weekly/monthly/yearly crime rates for different types of crimes (e.g. property crime, violent crime)
* Comparison of crime rates across different cities, states, or countries

##### 2. Geographic heat maps and choropleth maps
* Mapping crime hotspots and coldspots across different regions
* Visualizing the concentration of crimes in urban vs. rural areas

##### 3. Bar charts and scatter plots
* Comparing crime rates by different demographic factors (e.g. age, gender, income)
* Correlating crime rates with weather, economic, or other environmental factors

##### 4. Interactive filters and drill-downs
* Filtering by date ranges, geographic areas, or crime types to explore specific trends and patterns
* Drilling down into detailed crime statistics for specific cities or regions

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Vivek-Murali/data-crimes-case-study.git
```
### 2. Install the required tools:
    - [List tools]
    
See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
